How To Run :

The main page for this static webpage is "index.html." It contains all the necessary CSS and JavaScript functionality.

When a user opens the application, they will see a series of questions along with a "Next" button and a timer set for approximately 25 seconds for each question. 

If the timer runs out before the user answers, the next question will automatically appear.

Once the user reaches the last question, the exam will automatically be submitted.

After submission, the user will be able to view their score and compare their answers to the correct ones.
